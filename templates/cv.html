					I really really don't like popular social media platforms. I prefer longform content, forums and productive spaces.

					<h3>Gaming adventure</h3>
					<p>Phaserjs and P5js are game changers when it comes to 2D games. I've been spending way too much of my downtime learning about 2d canvas interaction, node based game development and browser performance of these simple game engine/libraries. Although I am learning about WebGl and using threejs a lot for browser based 3D, I'm hoping to settle on a story to build a game around some time in the near future.</p>

					<h3>Remixing/Editing</h3>
					<p>For no reason at all, my love for music and cinema intertwined to create a video mix circa 2012. I've been doing them ever since as a hobb for when the creative juices are flowing freely.</p>
