Jacob was startled awake by the sounds of neighbours screams. His heart sank. The last thing he wanted was for this to be real. He hoped it was a dream. The fatigue of emotional extremes he experienced that day still wrung his muscles into tight knots.
"Jacob! Jacob! wake up. Whats going on?" Chelsea asked wide eyed.
"No idea. get the kids." He said sleepily. He walked outside and a familiar smell stung his nostrils.
"NO no no no no no" he said a thousand times as he grabbed his badge and gun. 
"Jacob. The kids are in the lounge. What should we do?" Chelsea asked exasperated.
"Let them sleep. Turn on the TV. I'll be back." Jacob grabbed his ringing phone as he ran down the driveway.
"Zwane. What the fuck is going on? This too much a coincidence?" he said.
"Too much a conincidence. I'd rather not tell you the odds as you might draw some bullshit conclusion. Where are you?" Zwane asked. her voice  didnt sound as clear as it usually did.
"Woken up by the sound of neighbours. Something happened. Smells like a burning corpse but I'm praying it's something else." walters said out of breathe.
"I'm still in my sleeping clothes at the hotel. I have to go - we just got called into a brief by the Director. I'll call you after its done." She dropped the phone.
Jacob approached the house missing half its roof. The dogs were making a racket. Walters flashed his badge as he stumbled through the crowd. Some neighbours were holding each other and the shaken family. He recognised the father as Jeremy Naiker, a trucking mogul and his wife Nerissa. 
"Jeremy, what happened? are you hurt? Nerissa and the kids ok?" Jacob asked the shaking man.
"Jesus. Jacob. Its good to see you here. Ive never seen anything like it. a body just fell into our roof into the bathroom on the top floor. The kids sleep upstairs. The woke up and saw a mangled thing and bloood was everywhere. Fuck man. What can I do? I got them out and neighbours said they heard something. We are all a bit shook. Shook bra. ey." Jeremy grabbed the back of his skull in relief of anguish Jacob couldnt tell.
"Alright, I'm going up there to have a look before Nevin and Forensics get here. Leave your kids with mine, Chelsea should be awake with them."
"Thanks man. Thanks brother. You're a godsend." Jeremy went to sheperd his family to the walters residence. Jacob got in the house and turned on a flash light and gun out of habit. The upstairs had no lights but as he looked around he could make out footprints of all sizes leaving blood stained prints all over the marble floor and persian rugs. Other than a few out of place items the house looked like it did the last time he was here a few weeks ago. He climbed the stairs gingerly, making sure not to step on the bloody prints. His gun pointed straight on a high ready. As the first floor came into view, the scene changed abruptly. The celiing board was cracked and tubing and wiring dangled. a breeze too strong for a mere door or window swept through. That familiar smell hung in the draft and curtains swayed. On the left he checked the room, it was Mikayla's room. Even in the dark it was a bright pink. The second room was Brandon's and was a dull cream white colour. The bed was deshevelled but otherwise neat. The posters of steampunk were enough to give it away as brandons. The next rooms door was barely on its hinges. The flashlight was making concentric circles on the hardwood white coated surface. Jacob took a deep breathe and slowly opened the door. 
Inside was a mess of wood and tiling and some plastic insulation. A charred body lay on one side of the bathtub, the force of impact broke the tub and splattered the brains of the corpse. Jacob had an urge to regurgitate but held it together. Blood was all over the floor so he would have to gingerly navigate the mess. He shone the light on the "fallen angel" and the clothes were charred. Upon closer inspection, the body looked female although he could not tell any other detail. He backed out of the bathroom. as he made his way downstairs his phone rang. It was the Brig.
"Station commander. What do I owe the pleasure."
"Walters. I just got off the phone with the commissioner. He asked for you by name to be a special detail in the investigation of the 'fallen angels'. Son, is there something you know that the rest of us don't?"
"No Sir. Did he say Jacob walters?"
"No. He said Detective Jacob Ronald Walters. To make sure there was no confusion. He even gave your badge number. You're one of our best so I couldn't just allow you to leave. He said I'm not authorized to know he details. Walters. This is some high level shit. Just watch yourself out there. I have a feeling intelligence has their fingers all over this. I can't let you be a double agent you see."
"Sir? I;m not getting what you are getting at." Walters said calmly. There was silence on the line for a few seconds.
"Come on sonnny. Lets not play those games. Have you ever been in contact with National Intelligence?"
"yes sir but that was all in a report i submitted a few weeks ago."
"and they haven't contacted you since?"
"They have. We had a meeting for tomorrow but things are going a bit haywire on my end."
"Son. Things are going haywire everywhere. Just a few minutes before I got a call, the president was seen going into a crisis room with the cabinet and chiefs of the military as well as the Director of NI and our commissioner of Police. Shit has hit the fan. Bodies falling from the sky. a few seconds ago all media was cut and internet is something to only be refeered to in past tense."

"Sir I'm unaware of all this. My wife is on the line sir, we have a scene in our hands as we speak."
"Walters. Be careful out there. You are in the bright lights now. Only god can help you out there, because lord knows I can't." The line dropped. 
The phone clicked. Chelsea spoke in a forced calmness.
"Um. Where are you?"
"Down the street at the Naicker's house. Did Jeremy get there with his brood?"
"Oh. yes. They are here. We are all looking for Emily. You didn't take her with you did you?"
"No. I went to the scene. It's bad Chelsea. Really bad. Theres a whole bunch of kids on the street now, maybe she went with one of them."
"I'll send jeremy to look for her. Nerissa is in bad shape and I can't leave her alone. Would you look around whilst you are out there?"
"Yeah. I'll meet up with Jeremy and we can look for her out here."
"Um and theres a white sedan parked in the driveway. The man said he was sent to give you a special message? Jacob whats going on? I'm freaking out here."
"Yeah. Its important. Its the job I told you about...my last job as a homocide detective. Look I'll be there in a few minutes" Walters dropped the phone. He thought about Emily and ran at full tilt towards his house. Sure enough the white sedan was still parked in his driveway. When he was within reaching distance of his gate, the door opened and a young man in his mid twenties climbed out.
"Mr walters. Im special investigator Mark Calbridge. I have a message for you from SI Zwane" the young man pulled out his cellphone and punched in some keys. He handed the phone to Jacob who put it in his ear.
"Jacob, are you there?"
"Yes. Why not call me directly?"
"Protocol. You are now a special investigation detail of national intelligence. Your police police duties are currently on hold. Theres a team of about fifteen of us in a newly formed investigative unit. As of three minutes ago this is now a matter of national proportions and might soon get bigger. Millitary has been given the readiness order and some of the most elite infantry have been put on ready alert level 1. Do you understand?"
"yes but why is everything moving so quickly all of a sudden. Is your meeting over?" Jacob inquired.
"I've been given an order to update you as soon as possible. We're flying there on a special charter flight so I'll see you in about an half an hour." Zwane said as she dropped the line. Walters was getting slightly annoyed at how abrupt conversation were becoming.
"Thanks. Zwane is on her way here. You said your name was Mark?" jacob handed the phone back to its owner. Mark took it without looking and put it back into his pocket.
"Mark Calbridge. I'm assigned to Zwane's unit but my immediate superior is Atkins."
"Good to know. I'll go get changed and pack a bag. also my daughter, she's three and quite talkative. Barefoot. Have you seen her around here milling about?"
"I've been here for 20 minutes and no child has come out the house. Only a couple and their two kids went in." Mark gave a surgical reply. Walters liked the man already. Precise and to the point.
"Thanks mark. do keep a lookout for her. I'll trouble you to have a look around the immediate neighbourhood. Shes small and couldnt have gotten very far."
"Will do." Mark said as he started the started the car. As he reversed on the driveway he forgot that he hadn't given him a picture but Mark seemed to know who or what to look for. Jacob made a mental footnote of that before he went inside the house.
"Jacob. Can i have a word with you?" Chelsea pulled him into the kitchen,"who is that man and what does he want here?"
"Thats special investigator mark calbridge. Seems to be ex-military or a special detail like me. I'm part of the intelligence service now and they want me on my first assignment within the hour."
"Jacob, are you hearing yourself? Our baby is missing. The naickers may need some real professional help as they are breaking down one by one. Nerissa is long gone and she may need pills to calm herself down. The nieghbourhood is in upraor in the middle of the fucking night. You are telling me that now is the time for you to leave? You've barely slept 3 hours."
"Ive sent Mark to look for Emily around the neighbourhood. He should be doing the rounds. We'll find her OK?" Jacob kissed her forehead. She reluctantly accepted and muttered below her breath as she walked back to comfort the Naickers who were in various stages of grief and shock.
Jacob had a quick chat with Jeremy before rushing upstairs to grab a ready packed duffelbag. He jumped into the shower and was shaved within five minutes. Just as he was putting on his tie, Isabel walked in. She walked slowly towards the dresser and didnt say a word. She just looked at her father seemingly dressing for work at midnight.
"Dad. We can't find Emily. Where is she? Where is she?" Isabel's voice broke.
"We'll find her sweetheart. Look. I'm going to work so keep looking for her alright. You know how smart your sister is so she should be fine." Jacob said more to convince himself.
"What if we can't? What if something happened to her?" Isabel was now clearly sobbing and going into mild hysterics. Jacob embraced her a second time in less than 12 hours. More than the last 5 years combined.
